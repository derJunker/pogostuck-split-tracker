<sup>(Screenshot made on Map3; On other maps the splits are properly named. Due to limitations on map 3 they are currently only named Checkpoint 1-8)</sup>


## What it does
The ingame Pogostuck split tracker is pretty basic, this app tries to improve on that.
Additionally to the basic features it also has:
- gold splits
- sum of bests
- hiding splits that are skipped
- old split names (very important)
  
(Coming at some point)
- best pace pbs
- reset counters
- stats about performance (average pace etc)
- custom map support
- custom mode support (e.g. boostless, legend exam, etc)

This is a very early version of the app, so there are some bugs and layout issues. Ty for understanding üê∏.

## Setup
### Installation
So i personally would recommend using the newest release in the GitHub `Releases` tab on the right. For that just go to the lastest release and download the .exe installer!

If you want to get the newest changes (and maybe bugs) you can setup the project yourself.

- Clone the repository with `git` or download the source code as a zip file.
- Install the latest version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
- Open the project folder in a terminal.
- Run `npm install` to install the dependencies.
- Run `npm run dist` to build the application.
- Then in the ``./dist`` folder you can find the executable installer.

### Usage
When starting it for the first time, you need to set up some stuff. You will (hopefully) find all information in the ``Setup`` tab in the app.
If there are any questions just dm me on discord. I'd love to help out and receive feedback!

## Limitations
I only tested this on Windows, as most pogo players are on windows afaik. So it might not work on other Operating Systems.

Windows 11 insists on having a 1px border around every window. If that's an issue you: [this might help](https://pureinfotech.com/remove-pixel-border-windows-11/) (i didnt test it myself tho).

The Windows 11 window-shadow can be removed in settings. For all windows 11 users there should be information in the "Setup" tab of the app. **If thats not the case:** then contact me!
